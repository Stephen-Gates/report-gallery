## Settings

**Fact sheet type** choose Business Capabilities

**Wrap layout**  to display the report within the width of the display to avoid horizontal scrolling

## View

The views available will vary based on the chosen Fact sheet type. There are three types of views, based on: 

1. fields on the fact sheet 
2. fields on related fact sheets
3. tags


## Editing

Editing can be enabled in the report allowing you to move, remove or add fact sheets. These changes are made to the Inventory, not just visually in the report.
