There are three reports: 

- [Business Capability Cost](business-capability-cost-report.md) - *What is the IT spend by business capability?*
- [Project Cost](project-cost-report.md) - *What budget is planned for certain projects?*
- [Provider Cost](provider-cost-report.md) - *What is the IT spend by provider?*
