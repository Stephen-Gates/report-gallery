??? note "Design decision needed"
    - How should this be presented? Clickable images or a list? 
    - How should the report types be ordered? 
    
    Take inspiration for clickable images from the [Reshape your IT with 24 key Enterprise Architecture Views](https://www.leanix.net/en/download/reshape-your-it-with-24-key-enterprise-architecture-viewpoints) poster."
