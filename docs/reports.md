title: Types of reports

??? note "Design decision needed"
    - How should this be presented? Clickable images or a list? 
    - How should the report types be ordered? 
    
    Take inspiration for clickable images from the [Reshape your IT with 24 key Enterprise Architecture Views](https://www.leanix.net/en/download/reshape-your-it-with-24-key-enterprise-architecture-viewpoints) and [24 Key Enterprise Architecture Views for the Financial Services Industry](https://www.leanix.net/en/download/24-enterprise-architecture-views-financial-services)posters. Missing image for Factsheet Map report.

LeanIX provides many different ways to view and filter data to answer key questions.
