# Chatbot questions :fontawesome-solid-robot:{: .grey }

A Chatbot is another way to answer questions. [Chatbots require development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buq0Q-0vdcw&feature=youtu.be) so a limited number of questions may be implemented. Common questions[^1] are usually implemented first.

Chatbot questions may be:

- about the collection of factsheets, e.g. "How many applications do we have?"
- about a specific factsheet *name*, e.g. "Who is responsible for the application *Dynamics*?".  
- small talk to test the Chatbot's capabilities, e.g. "Are you a robot?‚Äù or "What can you do?"

The Chatbot will respond with:

- [the answer](../chatbot-answers/#answer), e.g. "*Alex Bailey* is responsible for the application *Dynamics 365*"
- a [clarifying question](../chatbot-answers/#clarifying-question), e.g. "Do you mean *Dynamics 365 Marketing* or *Dynamics 365 Field Service*?" 
- [how to access the answer](../chatbot-answers/#how-to-access-the-answer) if it can't be displayed, e.g. "To see a list of all applications and who is responsible, view the [Inventory][inventory]."
- an [apology](../chatbot-answers/#apology) for not answering the question, and a call to action e.g. "I'm sorry, I can only answer these [questions](../chatbot/#user-groups)."
- [small talk](../chatbot-answers/#small-talk) and a call to action, e.g. "I'm a very clever robot. Ask me something."

[^2]: Perhaps this will return too many factsheets to be useful? Return results in a meaning order. 
[^3]: Useful to inform people performing application upgrades that these make not be required.
[^4]: This question may be needed to help ask other questions if people aren't familiar with the factsheet names.
