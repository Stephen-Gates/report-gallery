1. [Project Portfolio](project-portfolio-report.md) - *What is the question about risk and value?*
1. [Provider Portfolio](provider-portfolio-report.md) - *What is the question about criticality and quality?*
1. [Lifecycle and Age](lifecycle-and-age-report.md) 
    - *How many Applications are Active or being Phased out each month?*
    - *How many Applications became Active each year?*
